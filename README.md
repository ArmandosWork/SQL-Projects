### Here is a Selection of Some of the Queries Written:
```sql
/* Q3: Which Franchise was the Top Seller and What was its Total Sales Amount in 2020? */
WITH Total_Sales_CTE AS (
	SELECT dealer_name, SUM(price) AS Total_Sales_Amount
	FROM CarSales..Sales
	WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' -- YYYY-MM-DD Format
	GROUP BY dealer_name
)
SELECT TOP 1
	dealer_name AS Top_Seller_Franchise,
    FORMAT(Total_Sales_Amount, 'C') AS Total_Yearly_Sales
FROM Total_Sales_CTE
ORDER BY Total_Sales_Amount DESC

```sql
/* Q5: Which were the Top-10 Car Brands/Makes that Sold the Most in 2020? */
SELECT TOP 10 company AS Top_Car_Brands, 
	COUNT(*) AS Total_Cars_Sold
FROM CarSales..Sales
WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' -- YYYY-MM-DD Format
GROUP BY company 
ORDER BY Total_Cars_Sold DESC
```

```sql
/* Create a View to store Data for possible Visualization Project with Tableau or PowerBI. */
CREATE VIEW TopCarBrandsView AS
SELECT TOP 10 company AS Top_Car_Brands, 
	COUNT(*) AS Total_Cars_Sold
FROM CarSales..Sales
WHERE date < '2021-01-01' -- YYYY-MM-DD Format

```sql
/* Q10: Who was the Customer Buying the Most Expensive Car in 2020? */
SELECT TOP 1 customer_name AS Customer_Buying_Most_Expensive_Car, 
	MAX(price) AS Purchase_Price
